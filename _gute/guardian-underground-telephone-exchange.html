<p>The Guardian Underground Telephone Exchange (GUTE) also known as ‘Scheme 567’ is a 1950s nuclear-hardened facility designed to safeguard cold war communications. It is one of three such exchanges, the others being <a href=http://www.hidden-spaces.co.uk/anchor-telephone-exchange target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Birmingham’s Anchor exchange</a> and <a href=http://www.subbrit.org.uk/rsg/sites/k/kingsway/index1a.html target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>London’s Kingsway exchange</a>.</p>

<p>The site was classified under a ‘D Notice’ in the fifties to prevent the media from writing about it. It was declassified in 1968, but apparently those with knowledge of the site were still having to sign the Official Secrets Act in the 1970s. These days its existence is public knowledge, and although details are still obscured from public view you can write to the council and ask about it, just like <a href=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/information_on_guardian_telephon_3#incoming-539762 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Mr McClinton did in 2014</a>.</p>

<p>By far the best source of information about the Guardian Underground Telephone Exchange (GUTE) is a 39 page 2013 paper co-written by Martin Dodge and Richard Brook titled <a href=http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/m.dodge/Guardian_Exchange_Manchester.pdf target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Manchester’s Guardian Underground Telephone Exchange</a> which includes a <a href=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cqKOOGNMOeU/Udsx5wEW35I/AAAAAAAAAzY/XqDE5rUb3j0/s1600/GUTE-plan.jpg target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>copy of Duncan Campbell’s floor plan</a> from his book <cite><a href=https://www.amazon.co.uk/War-Plan-U-K-Paladin-Books/dp/0586084797 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>War Plan UK</a></cite>, and a description of the layout.</p>

<h3>Underground Features</h3>

<h4>Telephone Exchange</h4>

<p>Housed in a collection of wide tunnels over 30m underneath China Town, the GUTE bunker was totally self sufficient for drinking water, having bored a completely independent supply for themselves. The artesian well is noted on the plan. The tunnels are still intact, although much of the equipment has been removed and although the area is still used operationally it is mostly dormant.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/uk.local.nw-england/gO4srQplfxU/rxdemD62PI8J">
    <p>There IS a bunker and a web of tunnels 112ft below Manchester, constructed during the Cold War to house the technical elite who would keep communications intact in the event of a nuclear attack on Manchester. Its location was a secret and its two entrances were anonymous doorways in Chinatown and at the back of the Piccadilly Hotel.</p>
    <p>It was called Guardian and was built in 1954 when the tensions between the Eastern bloc and the west were at their most acute. Apart from being on standby for a nuclear attack Guardian was also a fully operational fault repair centre for the city's domestic and business telephone systems.</p>

<p>YouTube user hogshawrabbits has five videos showing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8DsOUtpzTI" target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>inside of the Guardian Exchange</a>, including the <a href="https://youtu.be/t8DsOUtpzTI?t=40" target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>3D model</a> on display inside (which is also shown on page 223 of Underground Manchester).</p>

<h4>Cable Tunnel</h4>

<p>A one-and-a-half mile cable tunnel running under the city centre connects the main complex of the GUTE to Dial House and the <a href=#lockton-close-ardwick>Ardwick</a> and <a href=#islington-street-salford>Salford</a> shafts. The tunnel is wide enough to drive a small vehicle through, and staff in fact used a vehicle known as ‘the tractor’ to drag thick copper cables through before the age of fibre optics. Staff also used bicycles to navigate the cable tunnel, as it ran for quite some distance. This cable tunnel intersects the larger tunnels which housed the exchange equipment.</p>

<p>This is the most conspicuous representation of the Guardian Underground Telephone Exchange at surface level. Back in the postwar landscape of Manchester it may have blended in well, but these days it arrests the attention of passers by oblivious to its purpose, looking more like a prison than a government facility. Housed within is a large goods sized shaft down to the lower levels. From this location a 35 tonne cover (see <a href="#/images/gute/btarchives/gute-shaft-6-slab-tcb-417-e-25447.jpeg">photo below</a>) can be slid over the shaft head, and lift equipment is housed in a bleak looking tower.

<p>This is the southern end of the cable tunnel serving the Guardian Underground Telephone Exchange, where a shaft leads to a building on the surface. During construction the tunnel sloped at this point to remove excavated spoil; this was later filled in. The shaft head at this site has been rebuilt over the years and is fairly inconspicuous these days except for other surrounding utility buildings.</p>

<h4 style="clear:both;">Islington Street, Salford</h4>

<iframe class="figure-right" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m0!3m2!1sen!2suk!4v1493488839924!6m8!1m7!1sR4mKX1X_Y3UzWUftv_0BfA!2m2!1d53.48305083665677!2d-2.260853072507985!3f105.78167287406288!4f-5.985987723703019!5f1.584721843511058" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>This is the northern end of the cable tunnel serving the Guardian Underground Telephone Exchange, where a shaft leads to a building on the surface. In 2005 there was a break in at the Salford end which <a href=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/raid-on-tunnel-network-sparked-big-982416 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>sparked a terror alert</a>, which is discussed in a <a href=http://www.28dayslater.co.uk/guardian-underground-telephone-exchange-manchester.t9076 target=_blank/>28DaysLater.co.uk thread</a>.</p>

<h4>City Tower</h4>

<p>There is a rumoured connection between the telephone exchange and City Tower which is just on the other side of New York Street from the Rutherford House end of the tunnels. It seems rational that you would want to connect such a facility to City Tower since from there it would be possible to establish a microwave network with the <a href=http://www.subbrit.org.uk/rsg/features/backbone/ target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Backbone network</a> tower in Heaton Park.</p>

<h4>Rutherford House</h4>
{% include figure.html image="/images/gute/gute_rutherford_house_risers.jpg" caption="Credit: Richard Brook" height="300" class="figure-right" alt="Photo of Rutherford House cable risers" %}
<p>Rutherford House contains shaft 5 which most staff would use to enter the facility. On George Street signs could be seen at street level reading ‘DRY FALLER GUARDIAN’ and ‘EMERGENCY PHONE GUARDIAN’ until recently. They appear to have been scrubbed out, but <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/UfHNNSP42x82 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>you can still just see the word Guardian on one of them</a>.</p>

<h4>York House</h4>
<p>York House is an exchange building which contained the main staff entrance to the nuclear facility. The York Street entrance was housed behind the door opposite the street level signs indicating cabling. From here a staircase led to a shallow tunnel under the road to Rutherford House, and the main lift shaft.</p>

<h4>Dial House</h4>

<iframe class="figure-right" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m0!3m2!1sen!2suk!4v1493488354030!6m8!1m7!1sUSRfCanQY7dh4cDU2Y1Giw!2m2!1d53.48520833052226!2d-2.24770820017423!3f21.00207594916105!4f-8.616137846873585!5f2.491329588287855" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Dial house is a BT Telephone Exchange based in Salford, at the end of Chapel Street. A building with intriguingly intricate architecture, it appears to house equipment which pumps groundwater out of the tunnel complex. It also housed/houses the automated Pioneer exchange. The shaft is located on the north side of Chapel Street, as shown in the Street View image below. This location is marked on a map on a wall of the main tunnels, shown in the <a href=https://youtu.be/PlUh3hvCNVI?list=PL1eHvfPf7ldo_-KvmL7bsSsepXm4MSt4t&t=562 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>YouTube video from user hogshawrabbits</a>. It looks like there might be another shaft marked within Dial House, and a curved tunnel across the three way junction (purpose unknown). Models of the excavation of the shaft in Chapel Street can seen on the <a href=http://www.atomica.co.uk/guardian/ target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Atomica Guardian site</a> <a href=http://www.atomica.co.uk/guardian/Early%20Construction/pages/w2-008_psd.htm target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>here</a> and <a href=http://www.atomica.co.uk/guardian/Early%20Construction/pages/w2-009_psd.htm target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>here</a>.</p>

<h4 style="clear:both">Blackfriars Bridge Pump Outlet</h4>

<iframe class="figure-right" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m0!3m2!1sen!2suk!4v1493489368295!6m8!1m7!1spCQ8lSVaaZg4iclpWL4DCw!2m2!1d53.48369381727739!2d-2.247591927548058!3f10.868567957873989!4f-9.660489971162846!5f3.280839739990255" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Groundwater pumped from the tunnels below leaves via an outlet which is visible from Blackfriars Bridge or <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@53.4848284,-2.2459214,3a,16.8y,236.01h,86.38t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sTtULGRP2cyhALtsvvM50UA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Victoria Bridge</a>. Underground Manchester (Warrender, 2007:238) descibes how the pump at Dial House has caused a sandbank to form where the water is deposited into the Irwell. This outlet is also referenced in a <a href="http://www.manchesterconfidential.co.uk/culture/architecture/the-good-the-standard-the-ugly-dial-house-salford" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manchester Confidential article about Dial House</a>, and is listed under permit reference ‘NW/EPRTB3638AL/001’ on the <a href=http://epr.environment-agency.gov.uk/ePRInternet/SearchRegisters.aspx target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Environment Agency Public Register</a>.</p>

<h4>New Brown Street Shaft</h4>
<p>A shaft in this rough position was used to remove rock waste but back filled as part of construction (Warrender, 2007:221).</p>

<h3>Fire in the tunnels</h3>

<p>In 2004 there was a cable fire in the tunnels which wiped out phone service for much of Manchester. Information about the 2004 fire in the GUTE / cable tunnels is sparse, as the tunnels were relatively unknown at the time, and media information was fairly speculatory due to the lack of well known information about the layout of the system. There is a <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/3701267.stm target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>BBC News Story about the cabling fire</a>, and a further page about <a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/have_your_say/2004/03/31/phones_day3.shtml target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Day 6 of the Manchester phone crisis</a> which indicates the fire was approximately 150m from Rutherford House towards Dial House. This contradicts descriptions of the location which place the fire at the corner of George and Princes Street.</p>

<p>There was a <a href=http://www.28dayslater.co.uk/bt-guardian-manchester.t25365 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>28DaysLater.co.uk report</a> from a visit in the same year.</p>
