<p style='max-width: 42em; display: inline-block'>The Worsley Anti Aircraft Operations Room is a dual level concrete structure from which air defence across the ‘Manchester Gun Defended Area’ would have been coordinated against threats perceived in the early periods of the Cold War. It was operational between 1952 and 1958, after which it changed hands between various authorities being used as a food store, civil defence command post and even a meeting place for a gun club. It is currently abandoned, derelict and vandalised, with the occasional illegal rave (<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtxREoPnMCU&eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Efacebook%2Ecom%2Fhome%2Ephp%3Fref%3Dhome&feature=player_embedded target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>video one</a>, <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hA1rRyjlJOE target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>video two</a>).</p>
