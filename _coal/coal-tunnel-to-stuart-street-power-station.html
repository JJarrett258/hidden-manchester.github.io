<blockquote cite=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_Colliery#Later_years>After 1947 a 460-yard (420 m) tunnel 55 yards (50 m) below ground level was driven to the Stuart Street Power Station, to provide coal direct from the colliery. A conveyor within the tunnel delivered 200 long tons (224 short tons) of small coal an hour to the power station's bunker.<footer><cite><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_Colliery#Later_years target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Bradford Colliery, Later Years</a> on Wikipedia</cite></footer></blockquote>
