Welcome to a new site about Underground Manchester. This is the culmination of a fascination about Manchesterâ€™s underground features that has led me to compile the features I read about and find mentioned around the internet into an interactive map. This was mostly for my own personal curiosity, and to allow me to get a feel for the layout of things I was reading about. As I added more and more I found it fascinating how rich the history of the city is and was well and truly hooked.

Please [get in touch](mailto:underground.manchester@gmail.com) if you have any comments or questions.
