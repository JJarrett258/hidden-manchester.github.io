My fascination about Manchesterâ€™s underground features led me to compile this interactive map of features I read about and found mentioned around the internet. This was mostly for my own personal curiosity, and to allow me to get a feel for the layout of things I was reading about. As I added more and more I found it fascinating how rich the history of the city is and was well and truly hooked.
