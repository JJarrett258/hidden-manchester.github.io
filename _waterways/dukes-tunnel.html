<p>Before the current layout of canals, back when the Medlock was navigable by barges, it was used to transport coal on ships from the Duke’s mines out at Worsley to Bank Top close to Piccadilly Station. They did this by leaving the Medlock at Garrett Dye Works and travelling through a route known as Duke’s Tunnel.</p>

<p>The tunnel was completed by 1789 and it’s route can be seen on maps in Underground Manchester. The mouth of the tunnel is still visible along the Medlock from the train going past, and it is possible to see how much the Medlock has silted up from the fact that only the top of the arch is visible. I’ve read anecdotal claims that the tunnel was somehow connected to Shooter’s Brook, which would have joined the Medlock near to the mouth of the tunnel, and apparently kids used to be able to dive beyond the bottom of the brook, into the tunnel and retrieve coal which had been left behind.</p>

<p></p>I’ve plotted the tunnel’s route using maps and documents in Underground Manchester by Keith Warrender on pages 34–37, and from old OS maps of the area.</p>

<p>You can see a photo of the entrance to the tunnel on <a href=http://www.canalscape.net/Castlefield%20Canal%20Heritage%20Walk/Castlefield%20Canal%20Heritage%20Walk.htm target=_blank>Castlefield Canal Heritage Walk</a>.</p>

<blockquote>This tunnel was completed in 1789 and was 650 yards in length, 8ft 6ins high and 6 feet wide. Judging by the narrow width and lack of towpath the boats used must have been ‘Starvationers’… the type of compartment boat used inside the Worsley Mines. At the coal face the coal they carried was loaded into wooden containers which fitted in between the exposed ribs inside the boats (hence the name ‘Starvationers’). The boats were ‘legged’ through the tunnel and the coal delivered to the end at Bank Top close to the approach to Piccadilly Station. Once at the end of the tunnel, near the junction of London Road and Ducie Street, the wooden coal containers were winched to the surface by a horse gin… a horse-powered hoist for delivery to the adjacent Knowles and Sons Coal Yard. The River Medlock was gradually made un-navigable by about 1800 due to adjacent factories and mills disposing of cinders and other rubbish into it causing it to silt up.<footer><cite><a href=http://www.canalscape.net/Castlefield%20Canal%20Heritage%20Walk/Castlefield%20Canal%20Heritage%20Walk.htm target=_blank>Castlefield Canal Heritage Walk</a></cite></footer></blockquote>
