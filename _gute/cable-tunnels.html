title: "Cable Tunnels"
description: "A cable tunnel running under the city centre connects the main complex of the GUTE to Dial House and the Arwick and Salford shafts. The tunnel is wide enough to drive a vehicle through, and staff in fact used a vehicle known as ‘the tractor’ to drag thick copper cables through before the age of fibre optics. Staff also used bicycles to navigate the cable tunnel, as it ran for quite some distance."
