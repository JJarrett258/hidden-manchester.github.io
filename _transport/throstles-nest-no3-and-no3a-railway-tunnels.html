<p>These tunnels used to take the Cheshire Lines Committee railway line under Chester Road and Talbot Road near to Throstles Nest Bridge. You can see the southern portal of Tunnel No.3A now if you sit on the left hand side of the tram (facing forwards) between Firswood and Trafford Bar, just as the tram heads under the Altrincham line and turns to join it (see the photo below).</p>

<p>The train route can be seen on Bartholemew’s 1900 map from <a href=http://manchester.publicprofiler.org/beta/ target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Manchester Historical Maps</a>. Tunnel No.3’s northern portal just beyond Boyer Street is covered (from around 1988) by the site of the Manchester Audi showroom, and is very near the former site of Greater Manchester Police. Tunnel No.3A cuts under the corner of <a href=http://manchesterhistory.net/manchester/gone/henshaws.html target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Henshaw’s Blind Asylum</a>.</p>

<p>Flickr user TVurbex has photos from inside the almost completely filled in tunnels in his <a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/tvurbex/sets/72157680712723654 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Throstle Nest No. 3/3A railway tunnels</a> album. He’s kindly allowed me to include a couple below. There are other <a href=http://www.tunnelsuk.com/site_visits/2009/november/25_27_north_west/throstle_nest.html target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>photos from 2009 on Steve Power’s Tunnels UK site</a>.</p>
