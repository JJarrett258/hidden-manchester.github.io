    The building occupied by Armstrong had been years ago the old Deanery – that’s where Deansgate got its name," he stated. In the cellars, which had been wine cellars, was a small door which led to a tunnel. You went down 10 or 12 stone steps and then turned left to go towards Wagstaffe’s piano shop. I have been along it for quite a distance. I think this would be the one that went to Kendals. I presume it went to the Cathedral.
