This secret war room / bunker had a role in Britain’s defence strategy between 1952 and 1991. It started its life as one of 13 regional war rooms. For the latter 27 of those years this is where Manchester’s council would retreat to coordinate emergency planning during an attack or disaster. The building was semi underground and could be secured, housing air filtration systems, washing facilities, a canteen, generators, a scientific station, emergency communications and a food store.

Between 1962 and 1968 this bunker was reported to by <a href=manchester-corporation-main-control.html>Manchester Corporation Main Control</a>. There is a <a href="http://www.subbrit.org.uk/rsg/sites/c/cheadle/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Subterranea Britannica report on a visit to the bunker</a> in 2002 and it was demolished by 2009.
