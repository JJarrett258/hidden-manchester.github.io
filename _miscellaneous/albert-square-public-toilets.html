<p>As late as 1985 (and <a href=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/public_toilets_10#outgoing-547778 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>apparently 1986</a>) there were public toilets in Albert Square, between the statues of Oliver Heywood and William Ewart Gladstone. You can see the toilets in <a href=http://images.manchester.gov.uk/web/objects/common/webmedia.php?irn=82434&reftable=ecatalogue&refirn=2342 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Albert Square, Public toilets</a> and <a href=http://images.manchester.gov.uk/web/objects/common/webmedia.php?irn=82422&reftable=ecatalogue&refirn=31271 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Albert Square, from Town Hall Side</a>, both from the Local Image Collection.</p>
