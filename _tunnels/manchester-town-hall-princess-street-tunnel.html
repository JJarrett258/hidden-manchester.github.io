<p>In an interesting article about the renovation of Manchester Town Hall, the Manchester Evening News stated that a tunnel had been discovered leading from the town hall underneath Princess Street. It’s not clear whether there was an entrance from the staircase discovered in the Lord Mayor’s chambers. I’ve placed the pin close to that corner of the building though, as a guess.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/manchester-town-hall-youve-never-20959746">Below Princess Street, construction contractors working on the drains discovered an unexpected brick-arched tunnel, five or six feet in height. Boxed off in a corner of the Lord Mayor’s chambers, they found a cast iron spiral staircase.
