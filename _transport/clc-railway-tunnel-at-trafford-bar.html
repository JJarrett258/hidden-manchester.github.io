<p>This tunnel used to take the Cheshire Lines Committee railway line under Chester Road and Talbot Road near to Throstles Nest Bridge. You can see the southern portal of this junction now if you sit on the left hand side of the tram (facing forwards) between Firswood and Trafford Bar, just as the tram heads under the Altrincham line and turns to join it.</p>

<p>It can be seen on Bartholemew’s 1900 map from <a href=http://manchester.publicprofiler.org/beta/ target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Manchester Historical Maps</a>. The Tunnel’s northern portal just beyond Boyer Street is covered (from around the 1980s) by the site of the Manchester Audi showroom, and is very near the former site of Greater Manchester Police. Part of the tunnel cuts under the corner of <a href=http://manchesterhistory.net/manchester/gone/henshaws.html target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Henshaw’s Blind Asylum</a>.</p>
