<p>Sunlight House built in 1932 was the tallest commercial building in Manchester, and considered a skyscraper of its time. But in its basement Joseph Sunlight had a swimming pool installed, which exists to this day; it is now part of Bannatyneâ€™s Manchester health club. You can see the swimming pool on <a href=http://www.bannatyne.co.uk/healthandfitness/manchester-quay-st/ target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>their website</a> (<a href=http://www.bannatyne.co.uk/healthandfitness/images/clubs/hero-39a.jpg target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>direct link</a>).</p>
