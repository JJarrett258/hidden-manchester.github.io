    On the side of Castle-field is a large wharf, and a larger one intended to be in the centre of this field, formerly a Roman camp. There is a large and beautiful wear composed of six segments of a circle, the whole circumference 366 yards, which acts by the river Madlock [sic], in the same manner as that at Cornbroke [sic], to supply the canal.
