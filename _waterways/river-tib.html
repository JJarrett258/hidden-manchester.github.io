<p>The river is also mentioned in Geoffrey Ashworth’s 1987 book <cite><a href=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lost-Rivers-Manchester-Geoffrey-Ashworth/dp/0946361126 target=_blank>The Lost Rivers of Manchester</a></cite> where its overall route can be seen, as well as in <cite><a href=/sources.html#underground-manchester--below-manchester>Underground Manchester</a></cite> (although I think it shows the river about 100ft too far east). Its route from Peter Street to the River Medlock is shown in on <a href=http://enriqueta.man.ac.uk/luna/servlet/detail/maps2~1~1~340688~123190:Manchester-and-Salford?sort=Reference_Number%2CReference_Number%2CReference_Number%2CPage&qvq=q:william%2Bgreen%2Bmap;sort:Reference_Number%2CReference_Number%2CReference_Number%2CPage;lc:maps2~1~1,Manchester~91~1,ManchesterDev~95~2,Man4MedievalVC~4~4,nonconform~91~1,ManchesterDev~93~3,lib1~1~1&mi=0&trs=1# target=_blank>William Green’s 1794 map</a>.
