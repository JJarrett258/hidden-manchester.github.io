<p>Spectulated head of the shaft leading to the surface near to Dial House. This plot of land is still visible from Chapel Street, just over the road from Dial House where a raised shafthead still exists separate to the surrounding car park.</p>

<p>Zoom in to the embedded street view below to see the speculated shaft head.</p>
