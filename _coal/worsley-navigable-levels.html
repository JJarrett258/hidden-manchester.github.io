<p>Known as the Worsley Navigable Levels, these 46 miles of underground canal tunnels were built by the various Dukes of Bridgewater and James Brindley. They are split across multiple levels and allowed coal to be brought to the surface and transported into Manchester. The underground routes are taken from a combination of sources (<a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/28709338@N04/10446053395 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>1</a>, <a href=http://www.aditnow.co.uk/SuperSize/Underground-Canal-1_18241/ target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>2</a>, <a href=http://www.aditnow.co.uk/SuperSize/Underground-Canal-2_18242/ target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>3</a>, <a href=http://www.academia.edu/12812021/Bridgewater_250_The_Archaeology_of_the_Worlds_First_Industrial_Canal target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>4</a>) which do no entirely agree, so they should be considered approximate.</p>

<p>There is a great site with loads more material about the canal (including the passage below) here: <a href=http://www.daveweb.co.uk/canal.html target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Duke of Bridgewater’s Underground Canal at Worsley</a>.</p>

    The Underground Canal or "Navigable Level" as it was known, starts at the Delph at Worsley and runs north westward under Walkden and Little Hulton to Dixon Green. The four levels and numerous side branches give a total length of almost 52 miles. Work started in 1759, small teams of miners cutting the rock by hand, with pick, shovel, hammer and drill. By 1770 they had reached Walkden and Buckley Lane by 1801. For many years over 100,000 tons of coal a year were brought out through the underground canal, and it continued to be used for this purpose until 1887. It then served as a drainage mechanism, water being pumped into it from the mine workings until the closure of the last pit in the area, Mosley Common, in 1968, made it redundant.
