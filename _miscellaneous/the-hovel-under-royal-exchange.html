If you walk along Old Bank Street which leads from Cross Street to St Ann's Square you will see a grilled opening on the right. This was a lift that could accommodate very large delivery vans which descended to the level of Boots stockrooms. It was operated by a chap who looked like a miniature version of Fred Dibnah, including the cap. Once at the bottom the tunnels were large enough for the lorries to drive in the direction of Market Street and the stock rooms. At the end of the tunnel was a large turn-table set in the ground. The lorry would stop on this, the counter balance or whatever must have been very sophisticated, because one person could quite easily push the lorry around to face in other way so that it could just drive out having been unloaded.</p><p>There were numerous rooms, some very large, and tunnels leading off in various direction.</p><p>If you walk through the Royal Exchange Arcade from Cross Street to the Square as you enter, on the right, opposite the cafe, is a wooden door. This was the staff entrance for Boots and other premises at the time. From memeory it leads down 2 floors to the stock rooms/turn-table I mentioned above and various other little hidey-holes</p><footer><cite><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100127001924/http://www.aidan.co.uk/forums/manchester-local-history/29-underground-manchester-5.html#post769" target="_blank">mac2220 on Aidan O’Rourke’s now closed forum</a></cite></footer></blockquote>
