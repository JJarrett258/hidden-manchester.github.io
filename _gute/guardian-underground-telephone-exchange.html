<p>By far the best source of information about the Guardian Underground Telephone Exchange (GUTE) is a 39 page 2013 paper co-written by Martin Dodge and Richard Brook titled <a href=http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/m.dodge/Guardian_Exchange_Manchester.pdf target=_blank>Manchester’s Guardian Underground Telephone Exchange</a> which includes a <a href=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cqKOOGNMOeU/Udsx5wEW35I/AAAAAAAAAzY/XqDE5rUb3j0/s1600/GUTE-plan.jpg target=_blank>copy of Duncan Campbell’s floor plan</a> from his book <cite>War Plan UK</cite>.</p>

<p>In 2004 there was a <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/3701267.stm target=_blank>cable fire in the tunnels</a> which wiped out phone service for much of Manchester. There is a <a href=http://www.28dayslater.co.uk/bt-guardian-manchester.t25365 target=_blank>28DaysLater.co.uk report</a> from a visit in the same year. In 2005 there was a break in at the Salford end which <a href=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/raid-on-tunnel-network-sparked-big-982416 target=_blank>sparked a terror alert</a>, which is discussed in a <a href=http://www.28dayslater.co.uk/guardian-underground-telephone-exchange-manchester.t9076 target=_blank/>28DaysLater.co.uk thread</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href=http://www.mancubist.co.uk/2006/07/25/guardian-exchange-manchesters-cold-war-bunkers target=_blank>Mancubist</a> page seems to be offline at the moment but <a href=http://archive.is/ target=_blank>archive.is</a> has a <a href=http://archive.is/1Mjkf target=_blank>mirror of the Mancubist article</a>.
