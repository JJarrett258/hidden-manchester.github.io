<p>In 1983 an 1824 15 foot 10 inch waterwheel was discovered in an underground chamber beneath Dale Warehouse (now Carver’s Warehouse). Used until the late 1880s it powered hoists to lift goods from the Rochdale Canal into nearby warehouses, and a 70 foot tunnel housed a shaft which transferred the power to the now demolished 1922 warehouse directly to the south.</p>

<p>I’ve taken the exact location from a diagram in <a href=https://library.thehumanjourney.net/2410/1/Tariff%20Street,%20Manchester_Archaeological%20Assessment.pdf target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>this archaeological study of a nearby Tariff Street site</a>.</p>
