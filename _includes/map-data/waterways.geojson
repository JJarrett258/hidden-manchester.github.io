The River Medlock was gradually made un-navigable by about 1800 due to adjacent factories and mills disposing of cinders and other rubbish into it causing it to silt up.&quot;<br>Cas",

In the canal bed at this point is a chain connected to a wooden trap-door. When the canal is drained, this trap-door can be lifted to let any further water out of the canal pound between the 3rd &amp; 4th locks. This I believe is let away through the course of the River Tib.<br>This we were told by the then remaining Lock Keeper Tommy Stansfield who lived in the canal House at Chorlton Street bridge, then I think in his 80&#39;s, who also recalled that the last time it had been lifted was about 90 years before when his father had been Lock Keeper and a boat loaded with bitumen had sunk in that pound.”<br>Source (http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:JoC4JQ6IdBcJ:www.aidan.co.uk/forums/showthread.php%3Ft%3D29%26page%3D4+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk)<br><br><br>I have been unable to find the bench mark mentioned, and it does not appear in online databases of bench marks. The nearby lock is named Tib Lock though, and the Tib Lock House stood opposite the end of the entrance the Manchester Salford Junction Canal. I have been able to confirm with the Canal & River Trust that the trapdoor exists and has been examined recently. Apparently the coping stone mark is not a Bench Mark, but a simple line.",
