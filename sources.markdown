This map would not be possible without numerous informational and technologic sources which I have used to gather information about and pinpoint the location of features. A lot of my method is simply finding accurate plans, laying them over a digital map and tracing geometry over the top. In other cases descriptions are used to work out a location, and in many cases historical maps.

####[Underground Manchester](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Underground-Manchester-Secrets-City-Revealed/dp/094636141X) / [Below Manchester](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Below-Manchester-Going-Deeper-Under/dp/0946361428/)
Keith Warrender has written two books about Manchester’s underground features, which really fired my imagination at the beginning of this journey and which are heavily referenced by this map. His first is [Underground Manchester: Secrets of the City Revealed](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Underground-Manchester-Secrets-City-Revealed/dp/094636141X) and his second is [Below Manchester: Going Deeper Under the City](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Below-Manchester-Going-Deeper-Under/dp/0946361428/). Both are very accessible and available to purchase on Amazon at a reasonable price.\\

####[Hidden Manchester](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hidden-Manchester-Glynis-Cooper/dp/1859834019/)
Glynis Cooper’s book [Hidden Manchester](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hidden-Manchester-Glynis-Cooper/dp/1859834019/) features some interesting history of Manchester and while it does not focus on the underground, it is still an interesting read and has useful context.\\

#### [The Lost Rivers of Manchester](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lost-Rivers-Manchester-Geoffrey-Ashworth/dp/0946361126/)
This 1987 publication is the canonical text around rivers which have been hidden, culverted, diverted or simply forgotten: the Dean, the Tib, Shooters Brook, Corn Brook etc. You won’t find a digital copy and real copies start at £40, but there is one available for on site reading in Central Libraries local history section.\\

####[Subterranea Britannica](http://www.subbrit.org.uk/)
Subterranea Britannica’s website features man-made and man-used underground structures and space. It is a great well researched site with photography covering a massive number of sites, which tend to be cold war or nuclear in nature.\\

####[substormflow](http://substormflow.com/location/manchester/)
substormflow has a great section on Manchester, and is the work of one explorer mapping and documenting the various sewers and drains he visits. Features a fantastic [Manchester Sewer Map](http://substormflow.com/location/manchester/).\\

####[War Plan UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/War-Plan-UK-Defence-Britain/dp/0091506719/)
Duncan Campbell’s 1982 publication revealed (in many cases for the first time) how inadequate and futile Britain’s preparations for a nuclear war were. This is the source of much of the information about the GUTE, along with the ground plans.\\

####[20 Historical Maps of Manchester](http://manchester.publicprofiler.org/beta/)
This site allows you to view a number of historical maps overlayed with a modern map view, allowing you to see how an area used to be laid out. This has been priceless when trying to understand where long gone or obscured features are located.\\

####[John Rylands University Library Image Collections](http://enriqueta.man.ac.uk/luna/servlet/view/all)

####[Cold-War History in Manchester](http://www.atomica.co.uk/guardian/)
