<h4>Route Credit</h4>

<p>
    I started plotting the route of the two Lake District aqueducts by using <a href="http://www.tathamhistory.org.uk/aqueduct.php" target="_blank">Tatham History</a> which also has an awesome <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?ll=54.071074%2C-2.533035&spn=0.141019%2C0.291824&hl=en&msa=0&z=11&source=embed&ie=UTF8&mid=zIeIveLfRSRw.k0OsWzzaf7hQ" target="_blank">interactive map</a>, <a href="http://www.jdscomponents.co.uk/gates/haweswater/default.asp" target="_blank">Haweswater Aqueduct Access Gates</a> and <a href="http://www.jdscomponents.co.uk/gates/thirlmere/history.asp" target="_blank">Thirlmere Aqueduct Access Gates</a> by the Nutters Mobile Surveillance Unit. I spent hours poring over Google Earth and eventually a <a href="https://www.old-maps.co.uk/#/Map/361500/426500/10/101859" target="_blank">1913–1914 OS County Series map of Lancashire and Furness</a> which has the exact route of the Thirlmere Aqueduct marked.</p>

    I was then thrilled to find a <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/gec-dynamic-data-layers/AEMoaXT9uSk/JNSKToj6IkQJ" target="_blank">Thirlmere Aqueduct Google Earth KMZ file</a> and a <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/gec-dynamic-data-layers/j2CheuwlHhQ;context-place=topicsearchin/gec-dynamic-data-layers/authorid$3AAPn2wQed5gS3zmYFjpw6zS7Ze5xUYlGNbQLQ38I3INSZ65bQkYeXqk_IQRbY3L7uqYoehu3Pnwdl%7Csort:date%7Cspell:false" target="_blank">Haweswater Aqueduct Google Earth KMZ file</a> on a forum by seggy224 with the exact routes (although I was frustrated not to have found them earlier). They have put a considerable amount of time into tracing from Google Earth observations, Google Streetview stills and a lot of hard work. In fact they’ve done an excellent job… much better than I could have managed, so I was keen to use their data. I managed to make contact to obtain permission to use the data and have transformed the route from KMZ to GeoJSON using Mapbox for the conversion and <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/" target="_blank">jq</a> to cut down the result (which included features for each surface structure—way too busy when plotted on the map).
