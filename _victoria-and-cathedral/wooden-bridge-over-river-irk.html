<p>This bridge joins Walkers Croft to Todd Street / Long Millgate, and may well date back beyond 1650, as a bridge at this position is shown on <a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/manchesterarchiveplus/5280463248/>Berry’s 1650 map</a>. Now hidden beneath Victoria Station in the Irk Culvert, this bridge is preserved and used as a utility tunnel.</p>

    20ft below the Station can be found the original cattle bridge, which linked Long Millgate with Walkers Croft. It is now covered over and serves as a utility tunnel.

<p>I do suggest visiting Ojay’s entry on 28DaysLater as there are some fantastic photos documenting his journey towards the Irwell from Bridge down this culvert. Manchester Council’s Cathedral Conservation Area site has a lot to say about the area, and specifically mentions this bridge.</p>

    The first Victoria Station, designed by George Stevenson, was opened in 1844 on a former burial ground in Hunt's Bank. It consisted of a single platform to which the only access was a wooden footbridge over the River Irk. By 1901 the Station had grown to its present size and Todd Street had been widened in the meantime to provide a more appropriate approach.

<p>You can see this as the original access route for the single platform Victoria Station on the <a href=https://luna.manchester.ac.uk/luna/servlet/s/04lvjv target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>1845 Ordnance Survey Map in John Rylands University Library online catalogue</a>. It is obscured by a higher level bridge on the <a href=https://luna.manchester.ac.uk/luna/servlet/s/0f33lv>1891 Ordnance Survey Map</a>, which labels ‘Phoenix (Corn) Mill’ on Station Approach (marked on earlier maps as Mill Brow) as it leads to Todd Street. There is another report in <a href=http://ragpickinghistory.co.uk/2014/05/08/remnants-as-ruins-the-irk-culvert-manchester/>Remnants as ruins: the Irk culvert, Manchester</a>. The bridge is also discussed in <cite>Underground Manchester (Warrender, 2007:73)</cite>.</p>
