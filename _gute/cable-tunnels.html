title: "Cable Tunnels"
description: "A cable tunnel running under the city centre connects the main complex of the GUTE to Dial House and the Arwick and Salford shafts. The tunnel is wide enough to drive a vehicle through, and staff in fact used a vehicle known as ‘the tractor’ to drag thick copper cables through before the age of fibre optics. Staff also used bicycles to navigate the cable tunnel, as it ran for quite some distance."

<p>This cable tunnel intersects the <a href=guardian-underground-telephone-exchange.html>Guardian Underground Telephone Exchange</a>, which is built under China Town.</p>

<h4>Dial House</h4>
<p>Dial house is a BT Telephone Exchange based in Salford, at the end of Chapel Street. A building with intriguingly intricate architecture, it appears to house equipment which pumps groundwater out of the tunnel complex. It also housed/houses the automated Pioneer exchange. The location of the shaft Location is approximated using the map from the <a href=http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/m.dodge/Infra_MANC_catalogue.pdf target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Infra_MANC catalogue</a>.</p>

<p>Groundwater pumped from below leaves via an outlet which is visible from Blackfriars Bridge or <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@53.4848284,-2.2459214,3a,16.8y,236.01h,86.38t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sTtULGRP2cyhALtsvvM50UA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Victoria Bridge</a>. Underground Manchester (Warrender, 2007:238) descibes how the pump at Dial house has caused a sandbank to form where the water is deposited into the Irwell. This outlet is also referenced in a <a href="http://www.manchesterconfidential.co.uk/culture/architecture/the-good-the-standard-the-ugly-dial-house-salford" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manchester Confidential article about Dial House</a>, and is listed under permit reference ‘NW/EPRTB3638AL/001’ on the <a href=http://epr.environment-agency.gov.uk/ePRInternet/SearchRegisters.aspx target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Environment Agency Public Register</a>.</p>

<h4>Lockton Close, Ardwick</h4>
<p>This is the southern end of the cable tunnel serving the Guardian Underground Telephone Exchange, where a shaft leads to a building on the surface. During construction the tunnel sloped at this point to remove excavated spoil; this was later filled in. You can see the surface building from the Mancunian way ramp adjacent.</p>

<h4>Islington Street, Salford</h4>
<p>This is the northern end of the cable tunnel serving the Guardian Underground Telephone Exchange, where a shaft leads to a building on the surface. This was the site of a break in / equipment theft leading to an interruption in connectivity in the area.</p>

<h4>New Brown Street Shaft</h4>
<p>A shaft in this rough position was used to remove rock waste but back filled as part of construction (Warrender, 2007:221).</p>

<h3>Fire in the tunnels</h3>

<p>In 2004 there was a cable fire in the tunnels which wiped out phone service for much of Manchester. Information about the 2004 fire in the GUTE / cable tunnels is sparse, as the tunnels were relatively unknown at the time, and media information was fairly speculatory due to the lack of well known information about the layout of the system. There is a <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/3701267.stm target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>BBC News Story about the cabling fire</a>, and a further page about <a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/have_your_say/2004/03/31/phones_day3.shtml target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Day 6 of the Manchester phone crisis</a> which indicates the fire was approximately 150m from Rutherford House towards Dial House. This contradicts descriptions of the location which place the fire at the corner of George and Princes Street.</p>

<p>There was a <a href=http://www.28dayslater.co.uk/bt-guardian-manchester.t25365 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>28DaysLater.co.uk report</a> from a visit in the same year. In 2005 there was a break in at the Salford end which <a href=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/raid-on-tunnel-network-sparked-big-982416 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>sparked a terror alert</a>, which is discussed in a <a href=http://www.28dayslater.co.uk/guardian-underground-telephone-exchange-manchester.t9076 target=_blank/>28DaysLater.co.uk thread</a>.</p>
