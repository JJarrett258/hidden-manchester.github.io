<p>The Guardian Underground Telephone Exchange (GUTE) also known as ‘Scheme 567’ is a 1950s Nuclear hardened facility designed to safeguard cold war communications. It is one of three such exchanges, the others being <a href=http://www.hidden-spaces.co.uk/anchor-telephone-exchange target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Birmingham’s Anchor exchange</a> and <a href=http://www.subbrit.org.uk/rsg/sites/k/kingsway/index1a.html target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>London’s Kingsway exchange</a>.</p>

<p>The site was classified under a ‘D Notice’ in the fifties to prevent the media from writing about it. It was declassified in 1968, but apparently those with knowledge of the site were still having to sign the Official Secrets Act in the 1970s. These days its existence is public knowledge, and although details are still obscured from public view you can write to the council and ask about it, just like <a href=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/information_on_guardian_telephon_3#incoming-539762 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Mr McClinton did in 2014</a>.</p>

<p>By far the best source of information about the Guardian Underground Telephone Exchange (GUTE) is a 39 page 2013 paper co-written by Martin Dodge and Richard Brook titled <a href=http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/m.dodge/Guardian_Exchange_Manchester.pdf target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Manchester’s Guardian Underground Telephone Exchange</a> which includes a <a href=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cqKOOGNMOeU/Udsx5wEW35I/AAAAAAAAAzY/XqDE5rUb3j0/s1600/GUTE-plan.jpg target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>copy of Duncan Campbell’s floor plan</a> from his book <cite><a href=https://www.amazon.co.uk/War-Plan-U-K-Paladin-Books/dp/0586084797 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>War Plan UK</a></cite>, and a description of the layout.</p>

<p>The GUTE bunker was totally self sufficient for drinking water, having bored a completely independent supply for themselves. The artesian well is noted on the plan.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/uk.local.nw-england/gO4srQplfxU/rxdemD62PI8J">
    <p>There IS a bunker and a web of tunnels 112ft below Manchester, constructed during the Cold War to house the technical elite who would keep communications intact in the event of a nuclear attack on Manchester. Its location was a secret and its two entrances were anonymous doorways in Chinatown and at the back of the Piccadilly Hotel.</p>
    <p>It was called Guardian and was built in 1954 when the tensions between the Eastern bloc and the west were at their most acute. Apart from being on standby for a nuclear attack Guardian was also a fully operational fault repair centre for the city's domestic and business telephone systems.</p>

<h3>Surface Features</h3>

<p>Other surface features are listed in <a href="cable-tunnels.html">the page for the cable tunnels</a>, which run under the city centre between Lockton Close in Ardwick & Islington Street in Salford.</p>

<h4>55/61 George Street</h4>

<p>This is the most conspicuous representation of the Guardian Underground Telephone Exchange at surface level. Back in the postwar landscape of Manchester it may have blended in well, but these days it arrests the attention of passers by oblivious to its purpose, looking more like a prison than a government facility. Housed within is a large goods sized shaft down to the lower levels. From this location a 35 tonne cover (see <a href="#/images/gute/btarchives/gute-shaft-6-slab-tcb-417-e-25447.jpeg">photo below</a>) can be slid over the shaft head, and lift equipment is housed in a bleak looking tower.
</p>

<h4>York House</h4>
<p>York House is an exchange building which contained the main staff entrance to the nuclear facility. The York Street entrance was housed behind the door opposite the street level signs indicating cabling. From here a staircase led to a shallow tunnel under the road to Rutherford House, and the main lift shaft.</p>

{% include figure.html image="/images/gute/gute_rutherford_house_risers.jpg" caption="Credit: Richard Brook" height="300" class="figure-right" alt="Photo of Rutherford House cable risers" %}

<h4>Rutherford House</h4>
<p>Rutherford House contains shaft 5 which most staff would use to enter the facility. On George Street signs could be seen at street level reading ‘DRY FALLER GUARDIAN’ and ‘EMERGENCY PHONE GUARDIAN’ until recently. They appear to have been scrubbed out, but <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/UfHNNSP42x82 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>you can still just see the word Guardian on one of them</a>.</p>

<h4>City Tower</h4>

<p>There is a rumoured connection between the telephone exchange and City Tower which is just on the other side of New York Street from the Rutherford House end of the tunnels. It seems rational that you would want to connect such a facility to City Tower since from there it would be possible to establish a microwave network with the <a href=http://www.subbrit.org.uk/rsg/features/backbone/ target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Backbone network</a> tower in Heaton Park.</p>
