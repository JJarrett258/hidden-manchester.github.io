Manchester Town Hall served as a command post for defences during the Second World War, so it’s no surprise it has a reinforced air raid shelter in its basement. These days the space is used mainly for storage, but the Manchester Evening News has some <a href=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/beneath-manchester-town-hall-secrets-11854933 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>good photos of the rarely seen basement</a> and some other interesting private spots within the building.
