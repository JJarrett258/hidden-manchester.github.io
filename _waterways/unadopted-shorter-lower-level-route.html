This shorter and lower level alternative route for the Manchester Salford Junction Canal is shown on the Pigot 1813 map from <a href=http://manchester.publicprofiler.org/beta/ target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Manchester Historical Maps</a>. From my reckoning it would emerge around the intersection of the canal and the older Metrolink staircase at Deansgate locks.
