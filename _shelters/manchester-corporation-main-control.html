<p>The bunker was operational between 1954 and 1968. From 1962 this site reported in to <a href=alexandra–hospital–cheadle-manchester-regional-war-room-greater-manchester-county-main-control.html>Manchester Regional War Room</a> in Cheadle. It existed until at least 2002 and the site was redeveloped around 2005 into residential flats.</p>
