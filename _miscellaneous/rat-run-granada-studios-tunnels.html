    Known as the ‘rat run’ tunnels, this labyrinth of underground passageways and rooms is formed from a Grade II-listed colonnaded railway viaduct (circa 1870) with some parts stretching into the cellars of the Bonded Warehouse (circa 1867). The viaduct itself is supported by a series of cast-iron columns on stone bases.

<p>The colonnaded viaduct itself is a listed structure (along with much of the area due to it’s significant role in the heritage of passenger railways) and as such <a href=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1200805 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Historic England have a page about it</a>. Fascinating to think that there is a tunnel directly underneath Coronation Street! You can see a whole collection of photos and a video of the arches and tunnels, along with the leftovers from years of filming on the excellent <a href=https://granadagallery.wordpress.com/2017/08/29/tunnels-arches/ target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Granada Gallery site</a>.</p>

<p>There are some more photos of the abandoned Granada Studios in this <a href=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/10-eerie-photos-manchesters-old-11306748 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Manchester Evening News article</a> about the now inactive <a href=http://granadalandgallery.com/ target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Granadaland Gallery</a> project.</p>
