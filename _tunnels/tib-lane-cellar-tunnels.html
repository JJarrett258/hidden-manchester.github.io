    have you any information on the tunnel under cafe nero on Tib lane, it used to be Willoughbys wine shop and the wine was stored in a sub cellar. Leading off the cellar were some tunels that were bricked up when Willoughbys took on the shop. the only mention I`ve found on the web is that flax was washed in the river [stream] Tib in the basement of a building at the top of Tib lane. cheers ken
