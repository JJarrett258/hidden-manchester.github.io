<p>Here the Bolton Canal passed beneath the Manchester and Bolton Railway. The canal is being restored and this tunnel marks the end of the section currently navigable from the River Irwell. Just after this short tunnel another was built, known as Salford Tunnel No. 2, but this replaced by a bridge although still referred to as a tunnel. Downstream boats must pass through the new <a href={{site.github.url}}/waterways/manchester-bolton-and-bury-canal-margaret-fletcher-tunnel.html>Margaret Fletcher tunnel</a> under Manchester Inner Ring Road to reach the Irwell. You can read more about this stretch of the canal on the <a href=http://www.mbbcs.org.uk/salford.html target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal Society site</a>.
