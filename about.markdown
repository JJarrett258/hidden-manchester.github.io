My fascination about Manchester‚Äôs underground features led me to compile this interactive map of features I read about and found mentioned around the internet. This was mostly for my own personal curiosity, and to allow me to get a feel for the layout of things I was reading about. As I added more and more I found it fascinating how rich the history of the city is and was well and truly hooked.

#### Using the map

Each feature is shown on the map under a different shortcut. As you click on the features the URL will change, and you can share or bookmark this address to jump back to the feature. From a mobile device you can click the locate icon ![Mapbox locate icon](/images/mapbox/locate-pin.png) to mark your position on the map. You can choose whether to view the map, aerial photography or a hybrid of the two by clicking the base map selection icon ![Mapbox layer icon](/images/mapbox/layer-control.png).

To hide or show whole layers of features you can click the menu button ![menu icon](/images/menu.png) then the layers shown to toggle their visibility.

If a feature has an extended description then you will be able to click ‚ÄòRead more‚Ä¶‚Äô to go to the feature‚Äôs own page (for example [Guardian Underground Telephone Exchange](/gute/guardian-underground-telephone-exchange.html) where the feature is shown on its own in a map in at the top of the page. Alternatively you can click the name of the collection to view all the related features (for example [Guardian Bunker](/gute.html).

To quickly browse all the features choose [All Features](features.html) from the navigation above. You can jump to showing the feature on the map with other features by clicking the pin icon üìç next to the feature‚Äôs name wherever it appears.
