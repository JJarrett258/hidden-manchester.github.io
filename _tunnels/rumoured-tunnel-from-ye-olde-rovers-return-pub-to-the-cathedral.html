<p>This rumoured tunnel between the Cathedral and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye_Olde_Rovers_Return target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>test Ye Olde Rovers Return</a> is mentioned in <a href={{site.github.url}}/sources.html#underground-manchester--below-manchester>Underground Manchester</a>. The pub was demolished in 1958, but inspired the Rovers Return Inn from Coronation Street which was first broadcast in 1960.</p>
