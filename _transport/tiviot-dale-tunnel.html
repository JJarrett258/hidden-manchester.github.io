<p>Just the west of <a href=http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/s/stockport_tiviot_dale/ target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Tiviot Dale Station</a> trains entered a short tunnel. Slightly further west they would enter <a href=cheshire-lines-railway-cutting.html>another cutting</a>.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockport_Tiviot_Dale_railway_station">
    damage was caused to the nearby Tiviot Dale tunnel during construction work on the M63 motorway (now M60 motorway) and the line temporarily closed for safety reasons. The closure was made permanent west of Bredbury's stone terminal in 1982 (following the demise of the Woodhead route), the track subsequently lifted in 1986 and the tunnel partially filled in.
