<p>When building the Bridgewater Canal James Brindley built a siphon at Pomona to carry the Cornbrook under the canal and into the River Irwell. He also build a circular wear here to allow the canal to overflow in to the brook in order to maintain the correct height of the water. You can see a <a href=http://www.canalarchive.org.uk/Tpages/html/T2493.html target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>photo of Cornbrook Weir on Canal Archive</a>.</p>
