Judging by the narrow width and lack of towpath the boats used must have been ‘Starvationers’… the type of compartment boat used inside the Worsley Mines. At the coal face the coal they carried was loaded into wooden containers which fitted in between the exposed ribs inside the boats (hence the name ‘Starvationers’). The boats were ‘legged’ through the tunnel and the coal delivered to the end at Bank Top close to the approach to Piccadilly Station. Once at the end of the tunnel, near the junction of London Road and Ducie Street, the wooden coal containers were winched to the surface by a horse gin… a horse-powered hoist for delivery to the adjacent Knowles and Sons Coal Yard. The River Medlock was gradually made un-navigable by about 1800 due to adjacent factories and mills disposing of cinders and other rubbish into it causing it to silt up.<footer>—<a href=http://www.canalscape.net/Castlefield%20Canal%20Heritage%20Walk/Castlefield%20Canal%20Heritage%20Walk.htm target=_blank>Castlefield Canal Heritage Walk</a></footer></blockquote>",

        "description": "<blockquote>When we were digging out the Rochdale Canal, behind near where The Rain Bar now is, just below the 4th Lock up from Castlefield Jcn, there is a Bench Mark symbol carved on the towing path coping stone. In the canal bed at this point is a chain connected to a wooden trap-door. When the canal is drained, this trap-door can be lifted to let any further water out of the canal pound between the 3rd &amp; 4th locks. This I believe is let away through the course of the River Tib. This we were told by the then remaining Lock Keeper Tommy Stansfield who lived in the canal House at Chorlton Street bridge, then I think in his 80&#39;s, who also recalled that the last time it had been lifted was about 90 years before when his father had been Lock Keeper and a boat loaded with bitumen had sunk in that pound.<footer>—<a href=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:JoC4JQ6IdBcJ:www.aidan.co.uk/forums/showthread.php%3Ft%3D29%26page%3D4+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk>Aidan O’Rourke’s now closed forum</a></footer></blockquote><br>The ‘bench mark’ mentioned is actually an arrow symbol, and as such does not appear in <a href=http://www.bench-marks.org.uk/ target=_blank>online databases of bench marks</a>. The nearby lock 89 is named Tib Lock, and the Tib Lock House stood opposite the end of the entrance the Manchester Salford Junction Canal. I have been able to confirm with the Canal & River Trust that the trapdoor exists and has been examined recently.<br> <img src=http:///images/rochdale-drain-marker.jpg width=280 height=auto />",
