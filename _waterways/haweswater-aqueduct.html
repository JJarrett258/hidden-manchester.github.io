    [after the 96 mile Thirlmere Aqueduct was completed…] Subsequent schemes in the Lake District saw
    Haweswater dammed, raising its water levels
    significantly, and the construction of a separate
    aqueduct south to the city. Subsequently, connections to
    other sources in Cumbria have augmented this supply.

    The Haweswater aqueduct is 90km long, hundreds of feet deep in places, and allows 570 million litres of water to flow from Cumbria to Manchester every day. It took over 20 years to build and was commissioned in 1955 by the Manchester Corporation. The ‘mega-pipe’ provides the water supply for 2 million people across Greater Manchester. We invested £22 million on a detailed structural analysis of the pipe for the first time in its history.

<p>Although almost entirely underground, the aqueduct’s route can often be observed by above ground marks, and numerous inspection hatches. There are also a number of buildings, although these are not quite as regular. With six tunnels of 2.6 metre diameter, 31 miles of the aqueduct are big enough to walk / drive down. The remaining 32 miles are made up of four buried pipes between 1.2 metre and 1.4 metre diameter. The weight of the water over the 550 metre drop from Haweswater Reservoir sucks the water over a number of uphill sections—the whole system essentially acts as a massive siphon.</p>

<p>In October 2013 <a href="http://www.unitedutilities.com/watermen-haweswater-aqueduct.aspx" target="_blank">United Utilities surveyed, cleaned and repaired the aqueduct</a> over a two week period with no impact to the public… quite a task! They were so proud they produced a <a href="http://www.unitedutilities.com/images/Watermen_brochure.pdf">commemorative brochure</a>.</p>

<h4>Heaton Park Water Inlet Building</h4>

<p>Finally… after being cleaned at the Watchgate treatment works the Haweswater Aqueduct travels the remaining 1.5 miles to finish its journey at Heaton Park Reservoir where it joins the Thirlmere Aqueduct to supply Manchester with clean water. You can see <a href="http://www.mainstreammodern.co.uk/casestudies.aspx/Detail/17/heaton-park-water-inlet-building" target="_blank">photos of the beautiful interior and exterior of the listed inlet building on the Mainstream Modern site</a>. The building incorporates a large relief by Mitzi Cunliffe (a british scultor who also created the iconic design for the BAFTA award) and inside there is some sort of model and a wooden relief plan on the wall depicting the route. More is written about the building’s merits on the <a href="https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1376745" target="_blank">Historic England</a> list entry.</p>

    This small building is actually something of a monument, a testament to the worth of the massive engineering endeavours of generations passed. It is the terminus of the eighty-two mile long Haweswater Aqueduct and houses the inlet valves to the reservoir at Heaton Park.
