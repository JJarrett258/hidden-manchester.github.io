title: "Guardian Entrance on George Street - Shaft 6"
description: "This is the most conspicuous representation of the Guardian Underground Telephone Exchange at surface level. Back in the postwar landscape of Manchester it may have blended in well, but these days it arrests the attention of passers by oblivious to itâ€™s purpose, looking more like a prison than a government facility. Housed within is a large goods sized shaft down to the lower levels. From the location it is claimed a 30 tonne cover can be dropped over the entrance, and lift equipment is housed in a bleak looking tower."
