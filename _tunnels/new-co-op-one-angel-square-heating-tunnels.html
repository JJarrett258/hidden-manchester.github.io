    <p>There are three main tubes, 3m in diameter, running from precast intake “chimneys”. These are situated at ground level some distance from the building (see box, overleaf). Formed from in-situ concrete, the tunnels suck air deep below the basement levels before releasing it up vertical shafts for distribution throughout the building.</p>
    <p><q>… when we factored in programme and cost considerations, we decided against smaller complex tunnels and went for large, simple ones. And they are big. You can easily lose a dumper truck in them.</q> In fact the tunnels can bring in 50,000 litres of air per second, heating or cooling it by up to 4ºC, depending on the differential between internal and external temperatures.</p>
