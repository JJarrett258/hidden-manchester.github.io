<h4>1st March 2022, Ukraine invasion</h4>
<p>Hello readers. Almost 2,000 of you have landed on this page in the last week searching for things like ‘bomb shelter near me’ and ‘air raid shelter near me’. I wanted to write a note to all of you who are scared, to acknowledge that and to give you a virtual hug.</p>

<p>I’m guessing that people are trying to find what to do in the event of an emergency. Sadly I don’t have more reassuring news. You won’t find places to shelter on this page, as all these locations haven’t been used as shelters for decades. They are now mostly demolished and/or inhabitable, certainly not as well equipped as a modern home. I doubt public shelters exist in the UK due to the scale of investment required.</p>

<p>Hopefully danger is very unlikely to reach the UK. In the meantime, unless you are planning to start a new lifestyle as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivalism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prepper</a>, the best advice is probably to make sure you have the means to stay alert. Keep your phone handy, as the government will most like use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/alerts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emergency alert system</a> in the event of an escalation to give us instructions and information.</p>

<p>More importantly, look after your mental health. Try not to spend hours reading the news. It’s normal to worry, and it’s okay not to be okay. If you are struggling and need to reach out, <a href="https://giveusashout.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shout (txt 85258)</a> are a free, 24/7 confidential UK based service who provide text based support to people in distress.</p>
