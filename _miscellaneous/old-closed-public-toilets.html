    There is also an underground gents toilet right in the centre of the junction of Corporation Street / Miller Street junction. That was also closed off during the 60's. I've heard from various sources that these toilets and others around the city were the entrances to other tunnels.

    From memory, the toilets at the Corporation St, Miller St junction were closed when they started construction work for the CIS and New Century Hall.
