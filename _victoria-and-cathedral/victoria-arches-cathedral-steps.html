title: "Victoria Arches / Cathedral Steps"
description: "<p>Victoria Arches (also known as Cathedral Steps) is an area with many layers of history. The story goes back to the ancient days of Manchester where the city was little more than a settlement surrounded with water based defences—the Irwell, the Irk and Hanging Ditch. The road’s original level sloped towards a bridge at Hunts Bank over the River Irk and was later levelled out by the creation of a new embankment with a row of arched supports raising the road to a new level between 1833 and 1838.</p>"

<p>The original cobbled road continued to exist as a sloping passage which continued down to water level at the Irk, but was bricked up at some point around Fennel Street. These arches were used by commerce in Victorian times and from 1895 were used to access landing stages for boats offering popular trips to Manchester Docks and Pomona. In 1906 the stages closed and with the advent of WW2 the arches were converted into air raid shelters for 1,619 occupants. After the shelter closed access to the public toilets remained via a staircase near to the cathedral, roughly where the four trees are outside Hanging Ditch Wine Merchants marked by the pin on the map. Other entrances existed via wooden steps from both Victoria Bridge (location shown in the photo below) and Cathedral Approach. You can see plans for the shelter in the <a href=http://www.gmlives.org.uk/results.html#imu[rid=ecatalogue.334333] target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Manchester Libraries Archives</a>. A snippet of the plans can be seen on their <a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/manchesterarchiveplus/6774927380/ target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Flickr stream</a>.</p>
