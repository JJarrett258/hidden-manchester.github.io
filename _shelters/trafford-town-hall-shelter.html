<p>When Trafford Town Hall had a new extension in the early 1980s a large, controversial and rather shallow bunker was included in the construction. Although it was designed for non-peaceful threats it was in the meantime used by the emergency services and as a CCTV control room. By 2011 it was a flooded abandoned basement of the demolished extension which was being replaced by a more modern building.</p>

<p>You can see photographs of the bunker being explored in Skyliner’s article <a href=http://www.theskyliner.org/beneath-trafford-town-hall/ target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Beneath Trafford Town Hall</a> and in The Manchester Evening News’ <a href=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/video-nuclear-bunker-that-had-trafford-town-875453 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Nuclear bunker that had Trafford town hall chiefs at war is uncovered</a>.</p>
