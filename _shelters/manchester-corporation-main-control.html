This bunker built in the grounds of Greystroke Hall was operational between 1954 and 1968. From 1962 this site reported in to <a href={{site.github.url}}/shelters/alexandra–hospital–cheadle-manchester-regional-war-room-greater-manchester-county-main-control.html>Manchester Regional War Room</a> in Cheadle. It existed until at least 2002 and the site was redeveloped around 2005 into residential flats, when <a href=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/end-for-the-cold-war-nuclear-bunker-1155478 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>plans included the destruction of the bunker</a>.

<p>The location is vague as all I have to go on is the photo from <a href=http://www.subbrit.org.uk/rsg/sites/m/manchester_corporation_main/index.html target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Subterranea Britannica</a> and the gateposts for Greystroke Hall on Google Streetview below. Read about the <a href=http://menmedia.co.uk/southmanchesterreporter/news/s/365201_universitys_flat_plan_for_historic_hall target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>University plans</a> to develop the site.</p>
