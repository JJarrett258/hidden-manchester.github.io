title: "Fire Location?"
description: "Information about the 2004 fire in the GUTE / cable tunnels is sparse, as the tunnels were relatively unknown at the time, and media information was fairly speculatory due to the lack of well known information about the layout of the system. There is a <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/3701267.stm target=_blank>BBC News Story about the cabling fire</a>, and a further page about <a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/have_your_say/2004/03/31/phones_day3.shtml target=_blank>Day 6 of the Manchester phone crisis</a> which indicates the fire was approximately 150m from Rutherford House towards Dial House. This contradicts descriptions of the location which place the fire at the corner of George and Princes Street."
