Gore Brook may receive its name from a dirty appearance, as gore means dirty in Dutch. It is over 3 miles long (although perhaps longer as I’ve not found a definitive description of its start). It runs through Birch Fields Park and Platt Fields Park in Fallowfield and is culverted a number of times in Belle Vue, Rusholme and Fallowfield. Close to its start at Debdale Reservoir a culvert (nicknamed <a href=http://substormflow.com/drain/gorton-falls/ target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Gorton Falls</a>) carries the Gore over the reservoir to keep it’s polluted water out of it.

<p>You can see photos from explorations of the culverts on <a href=http://www.derelictplaces.co.uk/main/culverts-drains-and-sewers/29113-gore-brook-culverts-manchester-june-2014-a.html#.V69f9ZMrJE4 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Derelict Places</a>.</p>
