title: "Signs for Guardian Exchange at street level"
description: "Here signs could be seen at street level until recently. They appear to have been scrubbed out, but you can just see the word Guardian on this photo, taken in September 2015. Iâ€™ve seen (but lost) photos of the two signs while still readable, and if any reader has some I would be grateful.<br><img src='http:///images/guardian-street-level-sign-george-street-sept-2015.jpg' width=270 alt='Street level sign on George Street indicating location of Guardian cables.'/>"
