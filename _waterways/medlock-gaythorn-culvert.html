<p>This culverted section of the River Medlock flows under the First Street development, formerly the <a href=http://manchesterhistory.net/manchester/gone/gaythorn.html target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Gaythorn Gasworks</a>. It is shown as an open river on the <a href=http://maps.nls.uk/view/102344087 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>1845 OS Six-Inch map</a>. By 1888 it had been covered as shown on the <a href=http://luna.manchester.ac.uk/luna/servlet/detail/maps002~1~1~339805~123138?qvq=q:Lancashire.%2BManchester.%2BSheet%2BCIV.%2B10.%2B14&mi=0&trs=1 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Lancashire. Manchester. Sheet CIV. 10. 14</a> map. It was still following its original course at this point (shown dashed on this map). The route appears to have been straightened at some point since 1888. Within this section the hidden <a href={{site.github.url}}/waterways/river-tib.html>River Tib</a> meets the River Medlock.</p>
