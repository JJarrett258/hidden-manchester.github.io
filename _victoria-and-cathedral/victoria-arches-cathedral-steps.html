title: "Victoria Arches / Cathedral Steps"
description: "<p>Victoria Arches (also known as Cathedral Steps) is one of those areas with many layers of history. The space goes back to the ancient days of Manchester where the city was little more than a settlement surrounded with water based defences. Its original level sloped towards a wooden bridge at Hunts Bank over the River Irk and was later levelled out with the addition of a row of arched supports to a new level in 1838.</p>"

<p>These arches became used by commerce in Victorian times and with the advent of WW2 were converted into an air raid shelter. Finally public toilets existed accessible via a staircase near to the cathedral.
