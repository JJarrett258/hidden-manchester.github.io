<p>Stevenson Squareâ€™s underground public toilets have now been <a href=http://northernquartermanchester.com/stevenson-square-from-grey-to-green/ target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>turned into an art project</a>. I believe the entrance can be seen in <a href=http://images.manchester.gov.uk/web/objects/common/webmedia.php?irn=8554&reftable=ecatalogue&refirn=69192 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Stevenson Square, Manchester from Oldham Street</a> from the Local Image Collection. The toilets are mentioned by the requester of an <a href=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/public_toilets_10#outgoing-547778 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>FOI request into historic public toilets of Manchester</a>.</p>
